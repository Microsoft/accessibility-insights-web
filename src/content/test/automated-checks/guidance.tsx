        <p>The automated checks in {productName} can identify more than 40 types of critical accessibility issues in seconds.</p>

        <h2>No false positives</h2>
        <p>
            The automated checks focus on issues that can be detected reliably through automation. For example, an automated check can
            determine whether a button has an accessible name; it does not attempt to determine whether the button has a good accessible
            name.

        <p>
            We use the <Markup.HyperLink href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe-core</Markup.HyperLink> rules and engine for our automated
            checks. Axe-core is open source and actively maintained by a team of expert developers who are committed to quickly eliminating
            any false positives reported by users.
        </p>

        <h2>Fix these issues first</h2>
        <p>
            We recommend fixing any issues detected through automated checks before proceeding to the remaining tests, which require human
            judgement. The human-powered tests are easier, faster, and more reliable when the auto-detected issues have already been
            eliminated.
