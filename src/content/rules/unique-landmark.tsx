        <h1>Landmarks must have a unique role or role/label combination (aria-label OR aria-labelledby)</h1>

        <h2>Rule Description</h2>

        <p>Every landmark in an HTML document have a different role or role/label combination.</p>

        <h2>How this is checked</h2>

        <p>For each landmark, if there exists another landmark with the same role and label combination, it is a failure.</p>

        <h2>Why this is important</h2>

        <p>
            Screen reader users use landmarks to navigate through the page. Each landmark is announced to the user with the landmark role
            and, if present, label. If more than one landmark shares the same role/label combination, this would be either confusing to the
            user in that they would have no way to differentiate the content indicated by the landmarks.
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix it</h2>

        <p>
            Ensure that there is only one landmark of a given role in the document. If it is desired to have more than one landmark of a
            given role, ensure that there is a descriptive label distinguishing between the two landmarks.
