        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>Users must be able to interact with a website or web app using only a keyboard.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using a mouse is impossible for people who can't see the pointer.</li>
            <li>Some people don't have the physical capability to control a pointing device.</li>
            <li>Many people without disabilities prefer to use a keyboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Good tab stop design allows keyboard users to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Access all of an application's interactive elements in a predictable order</li>
            <li>Identify which element currently has the input focus</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Poorly-designed tab stops create high-impact accessibility problems. To learn more about tab stops, see <Link.Keyboard />
        </p>

                <h3>Provide a visible focus indicator on the interactive element that has the input focus.</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Input focus is commonly indicated by a <Markup.Term>solid or dotted border</Markup.Term> surrounding the element,
                        but other visible changes are acceptable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Make all interactive elements tabbable.</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users should be able <Markup.Term>tab to every interactive element</Markup.Term> on the page unless it is currently
                        disabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive elements include links, buttons, form fields and other input controls.</li>
                    <li>Watch out for "keyboard traps," elements that receive input focus then prevent it from moving away.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Make the tab order consistent with the logical order that's communicated visually.</h3>

                    <li>
                        In most cases, tab order should <Markup.Term>match the expected reading order</Markup.Term> (left-to-right and
                        top-to-bottom).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Make sure elements that repeat on multiple pages have a consistent tab order across all pages.</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>For example, site-level navigation bars should have a consistent tab order.</li>

                        Don't allow users to tab to <Markup.Term>text elements</Markup.Term> (such as labels) or other static content.

                    <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>They must actively dismiss the dialog (for example, using an OK or Cancel button).</li>

                    <li>
                        If the default tab order isn't ideal, first try to fix the problem by{' '}
