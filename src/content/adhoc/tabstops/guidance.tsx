        <h2>Why tab stops matter</h2>

        <p>
            Many people - not just those with disabilities - rely on their keyboard to interact with web applications. Users of assistive
            technology are especially likely to use a keyboard (or its functional equivalent), and poorly-designed tab stops create
            high-impact accessibility problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Good tab stop design allows keyboard users to
            <ul>
                <li>Tab through an application's interactive elements in a predictable order</li>
                <li>Identify which element currently has the input focus</li>
            </ul>
            Activating and/or interacting with each element via keyboard will be covered in a separate test.
            <br />
            To learn more about tab stops, see <Link.Keyboard>WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</Link.Keyboard>.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Tab stops visualization</h2>

        <p>
            The visualizations in {toolName} enable developers to see accessibility markup that's normally invisible. The{' '}
            <Markup.Term>Tab stops</Markup.Term> visualization shows:
            <ul>
                <li>The element that currently has the input focus, indicated by an empty circle.</li>
                <li>
                    The focus order, indicated by circles with numbers and connecting lines between them. (The connecting lines are broken
                    when you navigate across an iframe boundary.)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>How to use the visualization</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure input focus is on the element where you want to start testing.</li>
            <li>
                Turn on the <Markup.Term>Tab stops</Markup.Term> toggle. An empty circle will highlight the current tab stop.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the keyboard's <Markup.Term>Tab</Markup.Term> key to move the input focus through all the interactive elements within
                your test scope.
            </li>
            <li>
                As you tab to each element, look for these <Markup.Term>accessibility problems</Markup.Term>:
                <Markup.ProblemList>
                    <li>
                        An interactive element can't be reached using the <Markup.Term>Tab</Markup.Term> key.
                    </li>
                    <li>A "keyboard trap" prevents tabbing away from an element.</li>
                    <li>An interactive element does not give a visible indication when it has input focus.</li>
                    <li>The tab order is inconsistent with the logical order that's communicated visually.</li>
                    <li>Input focus moves unexpectedly without the user initiating it.</li>
                </Markup.ProblemList>
            </li>
            <li>Stop tabbing when you have tabbed to every element within your test scope.</li>
        </ol>

                    <li>
                        Input focus is commonly indicated by a <Markup.Term>solid or dotted border</Markup.Term> surrounding the element,
                        but other visible changes are acceptable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Make all interactive elements tabbable.</h3>

                    <li>
                        Users should be able <Markup.Term>tab to every interactive element</Markup.Term> on the page unless it is currently
                        disabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive elements include links, buttons, form fields and other input controls.</li>

                    <li>
                        In most cases, tab order should <Markup.Term>match the expected reading order</Markup.Term> (left-to-right and

                    <li>For example, site-level navigation bars should have a consistent tab order.</li>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        If the default tab order isn't ideal, first try to fix the problem by{' '}
