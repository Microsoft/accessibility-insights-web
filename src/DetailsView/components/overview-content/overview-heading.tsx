                    This page contains a summary that indicates the progress of your assessment. An assessment is a manual experience in
                    which you navigate through a set of tests that cover all WCAG 2.0 AA success criteria. Each test has one or more
                    requirements that can be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automated</li>
                        <li>Assisted</li>
                        <li>Manual</li>
                    </ul>
                    Where possible, {productName} "assists" the test process by generating a list of instances to evaluate and highlighting
                    them on the screen. {productName} also allows you to manually record failure instances.
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
