      This summary indicates the overall accessibility of the website or web app, through a combination of automated and manual tests, covering all WCAG 2.0 AA success criteria. Each manual test covers a set of related accessibility requirements, with provided step-by-step testing instructions and guidance. Where possible, 
      Accessibility Insights for Web
       "assists" the manual test process by generating a list of instances to evaluate and highlighting them on the screen. 
      Accessibility Insights for Web
      also allows you to manually record failure instances.
