# mock-axe-android test content

This directory is for the benefit of the "yarn serve:mock-axe-android" command (see package.json).

The specific folder/file names here ("/axe/result.json") are important to leave as-is because they
correspond to the endpoint that Axe for Android normally creates ("http://localhost:port/axe/result").
