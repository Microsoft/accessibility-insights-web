Accessibility Insights for Web is a Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Insider browser extension for assessing the accessibility of web sites and web applications.

### Running the extension

You can install the extension from one of the following links

-   ![Canary Logo](./src/icons/brand/red/brand-red-16px.png) [Canary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbcplehnakffdldhldncjlnbpfgogbem) (released continuously)
-   ![Insider Logo](./src/icons/brand/violet/brand-violet-16px.png) [Insider](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nnmjfbmebeckhpejobgjjjnchlljiagp) (on feature completion)
-   ![Production Logo](./src/icons/brand/blue/brand-blue-16px.png) [Production](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni) (after validation in Insider)

### Building the code

#### Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have at least the **minimum** recommended versions

-   Node - 12.13.0 (Check by running `node --version`) - This is the version being enforced on our builds
-   Yarn - Version >= v1.17.3 (Check by running `yarn --version`)

> In case you don't have yarn, please install from: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

#### 1. Fork and clone the repository

-   [Fork and clone the repository](docs/git-branch-setup.md)

#### 2. Install packages

-   Install the packages

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

#### 3. Build and run unit tests

-   Build and run the unit tests
    ```bash
    yarn build
    yarn test
    ```
-   Run the end-to-end tests (note: you must use a **non**-admin prompt to avoid [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36835130))
    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e
    ```
    There are more details in the Testing section below.

#### 4. Load the extension locally

-   Build the (unpacked) extension
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
-   Add the extension to your browser

    -   Click on the 3-dotted-menu in the upper right corner and then select "More Tools" and then "Extensions"
    -   Verify that **developer mode** is enabled in the upper right
    -   Click on the **Load unpacked** button
    -   Choose the following directory

        `./drop/extension/dev/product/` - bundled like a production release

    > IMPORTANT: Ensure that you are testing locally before pushing a change.

-   Look for the ![Dev Logo](./src/icons/brand/gray/brand-gray-16px.png) extension icon to the right of the address bar

#### 5. Commands to run before check in

-   You should run a FastPass (formatting and lint checks) before creating a Pull Request to master:

    ```bash
    yarn fastpass
    ```

-   If this catches formatting or linting issues, you can fix them with a combination of:

    ```bash
    yarn fastpass:fix

    # or, or individual steps:
    yarn lint:fix
    yarn format:fix
    yarn copyright:fix
    ```

-   We normally don't run the full end to end test suite before sending a Pull Request (we let the build agents do that), but if you are working on a change where you are particularly concerned about breaking end to end tests, you can run _all_ of our Pull Request checks with:
    ```bash
    yarn assessment
    ```

### More Information

[Developer Workflow](./docs/workflow.md)

### Testing

We use [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) as our test framework and [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) for browser automation in our end-to-end UI tests.

> This project's end to end tests require the ability to run a non-headless chromium process. Because of this, they are incompatible with non-graphical development environments (notably, a default WSL environment on Windows). For an example of emulating a graphical environment using `xvfb`, see [./Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). For details, see [issue #853](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-web/issues/853).

#### Using VS Code

To run a task from the command palette, press **Ctrl + Shift + P**, select `Tasks: Run Task`, and select the task you want to run:

-   `Test current file in VSCode` runs just the tests in the currently-opened test file

To debug a test inside VS Code, set a breakpoint and click the debug button or press **F5**.

To attach VS Code as a debugger to a separate instance of Chrome, make sure you've launched Chrome with the `--remote-debugging-port=9230` command line argument, and then use either of the `Attach debugger...` debug profiles from the VS Code Debug pane.

To debug using an external tool, run the `Debug current test file outside VS Code` task. In Chrome, for example, navigate to `chrome://inspect` and click `Open dedicated DevTools for Node`.

You can start an interactive watch session that automatically runs tests affected by uncommitted changes. To do this, run `Begin Jest watch session` from the command palette.

#### Using the terminal

`yarn test` runs all unit tests.
`yarn test -u` runs all unit tests and updates snapshot files.

`yarn test:e2e` runs all end-to-end tests - you'll need to run `yarn build` first if you've changed non-test code.
`yarn test:e2e -u` runs all end-to-end tests and updates snapshot files.

`yarn test:e2e:docker` runs all end-to-end tests in the same Docker container our linux CI build uses. Prerequisite: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Extra command line arguments and flags are passed along to Jest. For example:

-   To run a single or small number of unit test files, run `yarn test -- -- {FILE_NAME_REGEX}`
-   `yarn watch:test` will start an interactive watch session.

See more about Jest options [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html).

To debug using an external tool, run `node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --projects src/tests/unit --runInBand -- {RELATIVE_FILE_PATH}`. In Chrome, for example, navigate to `chrome://inspect` and click `Open dedicated DevTools for Node`.
